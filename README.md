# About NBA.Com Scraper ðŸ˜‚
stats.nab.com is a great resource to aggregate statistics on NBA teams, seasons, players, and games. This package serves the purpose of self-usage and will continue to develop more modules and functionality to scrape and parse basketball-related stats from multiple websites including **stats.nba.com** / **basketball-reference.com** / **nbastuffer.com** to acquire data for all these categories in pre-parsed and simplified formats.

The idea of this scraper is to request the auto-loaded JSON data from stats.nba.com and then utilize Pandas and Google Sheets functionality to process and store the basketball stats.
